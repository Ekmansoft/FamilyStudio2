This is a Beta release of a Genealogy software package called FamilyStudio aka. GeneaLite.

The goal in the development has not been on the basic parts such as entering people or 
editing family relations, but on tools for analysing and comparing whole genealogy trees.

Thus here are a few features that are supported:
- Importing and exporting GEDCOM files from any source.
- Importing ANARKIV data files.
- Connecting to the web tree Geni.com live, and performing the same operations on Geni.com as on local trees.
- Possibility to export cached data from geni.com as native or gedcom files.
- Saving and reading an internal file format (xml so far).
- Comparing whole trees from any source. Suspicious matches can easily be compared for easy manual transfer between the trees.
- Sanity check of any tree to a limited number of generations up to 19 generations, or an infinite number of generations. 
  Note that this can take quite some time if running against a web tree and many generations are selected.
